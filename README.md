# hello-world
Introduces me to Github
This is my first time on Github. I have heared alot of good stories coming from here! much information is here. Glad to part of the hosts of developers. programmers, Data scientists among other professionals from all over the world!!

Just like I had said previously, I am back to this host to realise my dream of becoming a data scientist. This is my quest through Cousera and the John's Hopkins University. It excites me to be here.
