# hello-world
Introduces me to Github
This is my first time on Github. I have heared alot of good stories coming from here! much information is here. Glad to part of the hosts of developers. programmers, Data scientists among other professionals from all over the world!!

Just like I had said previously, I am back to this host to realise my dream of becoming a data scientist. This is my quest through Cousera and the John's Hopkins University. It excites me to be here.

I'm back again here in 2019. Seems this is the future of Information gathering and knowledge sharing. I am now back as a software developer. I am really excited that I knew this way before anything else in the world of technology. Thanks to my amazing moderators and mentors from all over the world.I really appreciate your time and gestures. 

Welcome to Kenya and may all welcome me to your countries. I am blessed!!
